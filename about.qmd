## Focus

Descended from the statistics education research of [Joan Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Garfield) and [Bob delMas](https://edpsych.umn.edu/emeriti/robert-delmas), the LASER lab is housed at the University of Minnesota in the Quantitative Methods program of the Educational Psychology department. Our research interests, though broad, focus on the teaching and learning of statistics and data science as well as their assessment and curriculum development.
